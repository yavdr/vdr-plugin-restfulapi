vdr-plugin-restfulapi
---------------------------------------

A plugin for Klaus Schmidingers Video Disk Recorder.


Preface:
---------
This plugin has been developed to offer a modern API for other developers to communicate with the VDR.
The plugin supports the following outputs formats: xml, json and html.
It also supports the folloing input formats: json and html.

For a detailed API description, see API.html

Someone who wants to install the plugin on his/her VDR needs following applications and libraries:

    VDR >= 1.7.18
    libcxxtools Rev. >= 1231, which is available as package for Ubuntu in the yavdr-PPA's 

    The plugin can be installed like any other standard plugin (unpack, soft link, make plugins).
    For Ubuntu it is available as package in the yavdr-PPA's

Someone who wants to develop an application which uses this API:

    XML or JSON Parser (Depends on which format you want to use! - You can also use the html-format, but that one is more a proof for the restful concept and does not show all information!)
    URL Decoder or JSON Serializer (to send data to the webservice, required f.e. to create timers, searchtimers usw...) 

Configuration:
---------------
With yaVDR create a new file called plugin.restfulapi.conf in /etc/vdr/plugins/ .
